# TypeScript Library (tslib.js) Annotations

This repository contains the TypeScript helper functions (`tslib.js`) with annotated comments. The `tslib.js` file is a runtime library for TypeScript that includes helper functions used by TypeScript emitted code. This annotated version aims to provide a better understanding of each function and its usage within TypeScript-generated code.

## About `tslib.js`

TypeScript provides several utility functions to implement the language's emitted code, ensuring compatibility and functionality across different environments. The `tslib.js` file consolidates these utilities, reducing redundancy and enhancing code efficiency, especially for projects that produce multiple output files.

## Annotations Overview

The annotations in the `tslib.js` file offer insights into the purpose and functionality of TypeScript's helper functions. Here's a brief overview of some key utilities and their roles:

- `__extends`: Used to simulate classical inheritance in JavaScript, allowing TypeScript classes to extend other classes.
- `__assign`: A polyfill for `Object.assign`, it copies properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
- `__rest`: Helps in creating a new object with certain properties omitted, typically used for object destructuring.
- `__decorate`: Used in the implementation of decorators for classes and methods.
- `__param`: Applies metadata to class constructor parameters, aiding in reflection-based dependency injection.
- `__awaiter` & `__generator`: Facilitate asynchronous programming using `async` and `yield` in TypeScript.
- `__exportStar`: Helps re-export all symbols from a module, supporting the module re-exports feature in TypeScript.

## Usage

The annotated `tslib.js` is intended for educational purposes and deeper understanding. It's particularly useful for:

- TypeScript developers looking to understand the runtime behavior of their compiled code.
- Contributors and maintainers of TypeScript or projects that rely heavily on TypeScript's emitted code.
- Educators and students using TypeScript as a learning tool for advanced JavaScript concepts.
